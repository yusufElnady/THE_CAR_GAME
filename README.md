# THE_CAR_GAME

This compressed file contains the windows and linux builds for the game. Please note that it won't work on 32-bit computers. 
To download the game, click on the "game.zip" link in the repo's log, and after it locates you to the webpage where it says 
"stored with lfs" in the middle on the right, press download on the left, and then you should be good enough to go.

Also, for the linux version, you have to navigate to the build's location, right click it, and click on properties. After that 
go to the permissions section, and tick the box where it says "allow to run as an executable", and then you'll be ready to go.

I hope you enjoy the game! If you have any recommendations for the game or would like to rate it, please send me an email on :
