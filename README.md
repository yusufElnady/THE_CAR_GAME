# THE_CAR_GAME

Latest version: 1.2.2

version 1.2.2 is located on a new branch, and starting from version 1.2.2, each new vrsion will be located on a new branch of its own.

Starting from version 1.2.2, only windows builds will be released, as no one seems to want builds for linux, so until anyone asks for a linux build, there won't be.

This compressed file contains the windows build for the game. Please note that it won't work on 32-bit computers. 
To download the game, click on the "game_x_Compressed.zip" link in the repo's log (I wrote x instead of the latest version number), 
and after it locates you to the webpage where it says "stored with lfs" in the middle on the left, press download on the right, and 
then you should be good to go.

Starting from version 1.2.1, you will have the ability to jump with the car! To do that, you have to press the space button, but if 
the car is already accelerating, leave the up arrow, leaving it to move by inertia, and then press the space button, or else the 
jump won't be noticeable.

I hope you enjoy the game! If you have any recommendations for the game or would like to rate it, please send me an email on :
