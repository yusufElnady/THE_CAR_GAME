# THE_CAR_GAME

This compressed file contains the windows and linux builds for the game. Please note that it won't work on 32-bit computers. 
To download the game, click on the "game.zip" link in the repo's log, and after it locates you to the webpage where it says 
"stored with lfs" in the middle on the left, press download on the right, and then you should be good to go.

Also, for the linux version, you have to navigate to the build's location, right click it, and click on properties. After that 
go to the permissions section, and tick the box where it says "allow to run as an executable", and then you'll be ready to play.

To start the game, press on the diffculty button, and the select the difficulty you prefer (slide the slider to zero if you want 
the opponent to stay where it is, and slide it to 50 for average difficulty). If you don't select a diffiulty, the opponent will 
stay where it is by default.

Starting from version 1.2.1, you will have the ability to jump with the car! To do that, you have to press the space button, but if 
the car is already accelerating, leave the up arrow, leaving it to move by inertia, and then press the space button, or else the 
jump won't be noticeable.

I hope you enjoy the game! If you have any recommendations for the game or would like to rate it, please send me an email on :
